Girth GPT:Of course, Girth Mule! I can help you write a requirements.txt file for your Python project. To do that, please provide me with the names of the Python packages and their versions that your project depends on. You can list them in the following format:

```
package-name==version
```

For example:

```
numpy==1.20.3
pandas==1.3.0
matplotlib==3.4.3
```

Please let me know the package names and versions you want to include in your requirements.txt file, and I'll assist you in creating it.
